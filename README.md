# The Janitor

A cleanup tool for BONELAB, similar to Garry's Mod's Cleanup menu.

There's no point of using this in Fusion. Fusion already has a feature like this, but it only works if you're in a Fusion lobby.

### Can clear:

* Every spawnable
* Just NPCs
* Just Guns
* Just Melee Weapons
* Just Props
